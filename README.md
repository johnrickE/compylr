# ComPyLR

A set of Python modules to facilitate compiler frontend development.

The name is a blend of ***Com***piler, ***Py***thon, and ***LR*** (the latter refers to the fact that the parser generator constructs [LR(1) parsing tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_LR_parser)).

*These tools are not intended to be production-ready. I wrote the bulk of this code back in 2023 as part of a hobby project.*
